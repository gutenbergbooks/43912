<i>FOREWORD</i>
</h2>


<p>
<span class="dropcap"><img class="drop-cap" src="images/upperI.jpg" alt="I" width="64" height="113"></span>
<span class="dcap">n</span> this world war we are learning many lessons
from our Allies beside those of the battle field. The housewives of the
old world have much to teach us in thrift, especially in the kitchen.
Italian cooking&#8212;not that of the large hotel or restaurant, but the
<i lang="it">cucina casalinga</i> of the little roadside hostelry and of
the home where the mother, or some deft handmaid trained in the art from
infancy, is priestess at the tiny charcoal stove&#8212;is at once so
frugal and so delicious that we do well to study it with close attention.
</p>

<p>
If you have ever sat at a snowy table in the garden of some wayside
inn in the Appennines, a savory dish of <i lang="it">risotto</i> before you and
the music of the mountain torrent far below in your ears; or sipped a
<i lang="it">zabaione</i> in the portico of a cafe on the sun-baked piazza of
some brown old town clinging to a hillside of Umbria; or eaten
<i lang="it">fritto misto</i> on a <i lang="it">pensione</i> terrace overhanging the
sapphire Gulf of Naples, one of those inimitable haunts of comfort
kept by a handsome Italian dame who served her apprenticeship in
Anglo-Saxon ways as an English lady's maid; if any of these
experiences have been yours you do not need to be convinced of the
inimitable charms of the Italian cuisine.
</p>

<p>
The Italian housewife uses quantities of vegetables, many soups and
made dishes containing only a small proportion of meat and that the
inexpensive cuts. Vegetable salads are a staple, while fresh or dried
fruits, coffee, cheese and nuts are the regular dessert. The elaborate
creations for which the Italian confectioner is justly famous are
reserved for festal occasions.
</p>

<p>
At first reading many of the recipes may sound elaborate, but in using
them it is well to bear in mind the general plan of the Italian menu.
Each dish is usually served as a course in itself. A good soup, a
savory dish of spaghetti, rice or vegetables combined with meat, a
crisp salad dressed with oil and vinegar, followed by a piece of
fruit, a bit of cheese and black coffee make a characteristic Italian
meal and one with which an epicure could find no fault. It is a meal,
moreover, in keeping with the suggestions of our Food Administrator
that we use a minimum of meats and sweets and a maximum of soups,
fruits, vegetables, made dishes and cheese.
</p>

<p>
This little venture is launched in the hope that the booklet may pay
its way in new suggestions to American homemakers while it is earning
money to prevent Italian homes from being destroyed. The expenses
incident to publication have been contributed, so that every penny
from the sale of every copy is forwarded direct to responsible people
in Italy who will use it for food and clothing for the families of
Italian soldiers.
</p>

<p>
Additional copies may be had at fifty cents apiece, from Julia Lovejoy
Cuniberti, 14 West Milwaukee street, Janesville, Wisconsin.

<a name="suggestions">&nbsp;</a>
<i>SUGGESTIONS</i>
</h2>


<p>
TOMATO PASTE. This is a concentrated paste made from tomatoes and
spices to be had of importers or grocers in Italian neighborhoods.
Thinned with water, it is a much used ingredient in Italian recipes.
Catsup and concentrated tomato soup do not make satisfactory
substitutes as they are too sweet in flavor, but canned tomatoes
seasoned with salt and a bit of bay leaf, cooked down to a thick cream
and rubbed through a sieve, serve very well in lieu of tomato paste.
</p>

<p>
PARMESAN CHEESE. When an Italian recipe calls for grated cheese it
usually means Parmesan. This is practically unobtainable now, except
the grated, bottled cheese, which is inferior in flavor. Gruy&#232;re, our
own brick cheese, or any skim milk cheese dried and grated fresh as
needed makes a good substitute.
</p>

<p>
DRIED MUSHROOMS. These may be had of importers or small groceries in
foreign neighborhoods. They sound expensive until one realizes that a
very few ounces go a long way. They make a pleasing variety added to
soups or sauces, and are much cheaper and more highly flavored than
the canned mushrooms. They should be thoroughly washed and softened in
warm water before using.
</p>

<p>
ANCHOVIES. These recipes do not call for the filets of anchovy
prepared for <i lang="fr">hors-d'oeuvres</i>, but the less expensive and larger
whole anchovies in salt to be had in bulk or cans at large dealers. To
clean them plunge in boiling water. This loosens the skin and removes
superfluous salt. Remove head, tail, backbone and skin and they are
ready for use.
</p>

<p>
GARLIC. Garlic is an inoffensive and wholesome ingredient if properly
handled. Used in small quantities and thoroughly cooked it gives an
indescribable flavor that is never disagreeable. By "a clove of
garlic" is meant one of the tiny sections of a whole garlic peeled
down to its white, fleshy core.
</p>

<p>
SUBSTITUTION OF OTHER INGREDIENTS. Many of the recipes which have been
written down just as they were given can be made more economical and
no less delicious by the substitution of clarified drippings,
vegetable shortenings and corn or nut oils for salt pork, butter or
bacon. Corn-starch is recommended for thickening instead of flour.
Anyone who does not care for as much cheese or tomato as the Italian
likes, may omit them entirely or greatly reduce the quantity in most
of the recipes and still have an excellent dish.

<a name="brownstock">&nbsp;</a>
BROWN STOCK
<br>
<i lang="it">Sugo di Carne</i>
</h3>

<ul>
<li>1 lb. beef from some tough but juicy cut</li>
<li>A small piece of salt pork</li>
<li>A large onion</li>
<li>A stalk of celery</li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>A carrot</li>
<li>2 cloves</li>
<li>Salt, pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>
Chop the pork and put it in the bottom of a saucepan. Next add the
onion, celery and carrot chopped. Dot with butter and over this place
the meat cut into small pieces. Add any trimmings from steaks, roasts
or chops that may be on hand and any bits of left over cooked meat.
Season with salt and the cloves. Put over the fire without stirring.
When you smell the onions getting very brown turn the meat and when
everything is extremely brown add a cup of water and let it cook
almost dry. Repeat this operation of adding the water three times.
Finally add three pints of boiling water and let it boil gently five
or six hours, when the stock will be reduced to a few cupfuls. Strain,
cool and skim off the fat which will form a cake on top of the liquid.
</p>

<p>
The meat may afterwards be used for a
<i lang="it">Flam</i>, for
<i lang="it">Polpettone</i> or croquettes. The stock may be kept for some days
and forms the basis for many dishes. In soups it is far superior to
beef extract or bouillon cubes which may be substituted for it.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="vegchowder">&nbsp;</a>
VEGETABLE CHOWDER
<br>
<i lang="it">Minestrone alla Milanese</i>
</h3>

<ul>
<li>&#189; lb. salt pork</li>
<li>2 or 3 sprigs parsley</li>
<li>1 kernel garlic</li>
<li>2 carrots</li>
<li>&#188; medium sized cabbage</li>
<li>1 scant cup dried beans, Lima or kidney, soaked over night</li>
<li>2 quarts cold water</li>
<li>A little celery</li>
<li>Any left over peas</li>
<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
<li>Rice, salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>
Cut off the rind of the pork and put it into 2 quarts of water to
boil. Cut off a small slice of the pork and beat it to a paste with
the parsley and garlic. Add this paste to the pork and water. Slice
the carrots, cut the rib out of the cabbage leaves. Add the carrots,
cabbage leaves, other vegetables, seasoning and butter to the soup,
and let it boil slowly for 2&#189; hours. The last &#189; hour add 1 small
handful of rice for each person.
</p>

<p>
When the pork is very soft, remove and slice in little ribbons and put
it back.
</p>

<p>
This is equally good eaten cold. Three bouillon cubes may be used
instead of pork, or may be added if a richer soup is desired.

<a name="frenchonion">&nbsp;</a>
FRENCH ONION SOUP
<br>
<i lang="it">Minestra di Cipolla alla Francese</i>
</h3>

<ul>
<li>4 large onions</li>
<li>4 tablespoons of vegetable oil or meat drippings</li>
<li>&#188; lb. Swiss or American brick cheese, grated</li>
<li>1 quart to 3 pints soup stock or boiling water</li>
<li>4 slices of stale bread toasted, salt, pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>
Peel the onions and slice them very thin. Fry them slowly in the fat
until they are a uniform golden brown, using a kettle deep enough to
hold the water afterwards. When the onions are thoroughly fried add
the hot water, cover and let simmer at least three-quarters of an
hour, seasoning to taste. The onions will make a clean brown liquor
without the use of any meat but soup stock may be used instead of
water, or beef extract or bouillon cubes may be added to the water if
a meat soup is preferred.
</p>

<p>
Put the soup in a hot tureen, add the toast cut into triangles and
sprinkle it over with the grated cheese. Serve as soon as the toast
and cheese have been added.

PARADISE SOUP
<br>
<i lang="it">Minestra del Paradiso</i>

<ul>
<li>4 tablespoons sifted bread crumbs</li>

<li>1 quart white soup stock or clear broth</li>
<li>3 eggs</li>
<li>Nutmeg</li>
<li>Salt, pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>
Beat the whites of the eggs, then beat in the yolks. Add the
breadcrumbs gradually, then the grated cheese, a pinch of salt and a
grating of nutmeg. These ingredients should form a thin batter.
</p>

<p>
Have the broth boiling and drop the batter into it by spoonfuls. Let
it boil three or four minutes and serve immediately. The batter will
poach in soft, curdled lumps in the clear soup.
</p>

<p>
This soup is much used as a delicacy for invalids. In this case the
cheese may be scanted or omitted entirely. By way of variety a
tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley may be added to the batter, or
a half a cup of spinach drained and rubbed through a sieve may be
substituted for half of the breadcrumbs.
</p>

<p>
When stock or broth is not available, it may be made from bouillon
cubes and a lump of butter dissolved in boiling water and seasoned
with celery salt, onion salt and pepper.

<p>
Chop the onion and fry in oil. The other vegetables should be in
proportion to each other. For example, if there is a cupful of each of
the other vegetables when they are cut up, use a cupful of tomatoes
unless you wish the tomato flavor to be very pronounced. Peel and cube
the potatoes, eggplant and squash. Remove the seeds and stems from the
peppers and slice or shred them coarsely. Add the tomatoes to the
onion and oil. After that has cooked a few minutes add the potatoes.
When they are half done, put in the peppers, lastly the eggplant,
squash, and salt and pepper. Continue cooking until the vegetables are
tender but still whole and firm.

Grind the salt pork and try it out in a saucepan. While it is frying

add the onion, the parsley chopped, the garlic shredded fine, and the
mushrooms which have been softened by soaking in warm water. When the
vegetables are very brown (great care must be taken not to burn the
onion, which scorches very easily) add the meat ground coarsely or cut
up in little cubes. When the meat is a good brown color, add about one
pint of tomatoes and simmer slowly until all has cooked down to a
thick creamy sauce. It will probably take &#190; hour. The sauce may be
bound together with a little flour if it shows a tendency to separate.

This sauce is used to dress all kinds of macaroni and spaghetti, also

If it is too long to fit in the kettle immerse one end in the boiling
salted water and in a very few minutes the ends of the spaghetti under
the water will become softened so that the rest can be pushed down
into the kettle. Be careful not to overcook it and it will not be
pasty, but firm and tender. Drain it carefully and put in a hot soup
tureen. Sprinkle a handful of grated cheese over it and pour on the
sauce. Lift with two forks until thoroughly mixed.

</h3>

<p>
The best and most tender paste is made simply of eggs and flour and
salt. Water may be substituted for part of the eggs, for economy, or
when a less rich paste is needed. Allow about a cup of flour to an
egg. Put the flour on a bread board, make a hole in the middle and
break in the egg. Use any extra whites that are on hand. Work it with
a fork until it is firm enough to work with the hands. Knead it
thoroughly, adding more flour if necessary, until you have a paste you
can roll out. Roll it as thin as a ten cent piece. If the sheet of
paste is too large to handle with an ordinary rolling pin, a broom
handle which has been sawed off, scrubbed and sandpapered, will serve
in lieu of the long Italian rolling pin.
</p>

<p>
This paste may be cut in ribbons to be cooked in soup as
<i lang="it">Tagliatelli</i>, or cut in squares or circles and filled with
various mixtures to make <i lang="it">Cappelletti</i>, <i lang="it">Ravioli</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>
Any bits that are left or become too dry to work may be made into a
ball and kept for some time to be grated into soup, in which it makes
an excellent thickening.

<p>
Drain and chop the greens. Mix well with the curds, egg, a little grated
cheese, salt and nutmeg. Make a paste such as that described in the
recipe for <i lang="it">Pasta fatta in Casa</i>, <a href="#ref20">page
20.</a> Roll out this paste very thin and mark it off in two or three
inch squares. Place a spoonful of the mixture on each square. Fold
together diagonally. Moisten the edges with the finger dipped in cold
water, to make them stick together, and press them down with the fingers
or the tines of a fork. Another method is to put the spoonfuls of the
mixture in a row two inches from the edge of the paste and two inches
apart. Fold over the edge of the paste. Cut off the whole strip thus
formed, and cut into squares with the mixture in the middle of each
square.

<p>
Boil these <i>ravioli</i> in salted water, being careful not to

TOMATO SAUCE
<br>
<i lang="it">Salsa di Pomidoro</i>
</h3>

<p>
Pellegrino Artusi, the inimitable author of that droll yet practical
manual of cooking SCIENCE IN THE KITCHEN AND THE ART OF EATING WELL
(La Scienza in Cucina e l'Arte di mangiar bene) has the following to
say about tomato sauce.
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
"There was once a good old priest in a village of the Romagna who
stuck his nose into everything; in every family circle and in every
domestic affair he wanted to have his finger in the pie. Aside from
this he was a kindly old party and as his zeal was the source of more
good than bad people let him go his way; but the wiseacres dubbed him
Don Pomidoro (Sir Tomato) to indicate that tomatoes enter into
everything; therefore a good tomato sauce is an invaluable aid in
cooking."
</p>
</div>

<p>
Chop fine together a quarter of an onion, a clove of garlic, a piece
of celery as long as your finger, a few bay leaves and just parsley
enough. Season with a little oil, salt and pepper, cut up seven or
eight tomatoes and put everything over the fire together. Stir it from
time to time and when you see the juice condensing into a thin custard
strain it through a sieve, and it is ready for use."
</p>

<p>
This sauce serves many purposes. It is good on boiled meat; excellent
to dress macaroni, spaghetti or other pastes which have been seasoned
with butter and cheese, or on boiled rice seasoned in the same way.
Mushrooms are a great addition to it.
</p>

<li>Yolk of 1 egg</li>
</ul>

<p>
Melt half the butter, add the flour and cook until it begins to brown.
Add the water slowly, stirring meanwhile, the vinegar and the rest of
the butter. Take from the fire and add the beaten egg yolk. This sauce
should be smooth like a thin custard.

It is best to cook Zabaione in a double boiler or in a dish set into a

<p>
Orange or other fruit juice may be substituted for the wine, but
Marsala is the original and authentic ingredient. Made with fruit
